## Features
- Predicts stock prices using past trends.
- Implements **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for time-series forecasting.
- Scales and preprocesses data for improved accuracy.
- Visualizes predictions vs. actual stock prices using graphs.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: Data preprocessing (`MinMaxScaler`).
  - `tensorflow`/`keras`: Building and training LSTM models.
